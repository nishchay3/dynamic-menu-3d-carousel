A page consisting of dynamic header menu item and an infinite 3d carousel

# Requirements:

## Tech requirement:

- ReactJs (functional components)
- Custom CSS styles (sass will be preferred).

## Requirement 1: Dynamic Menu

- Develop a dynamic navigation menu that prominently displays a predetermined list of items.
- Implement functionality to automatically transfer remaining items to a designated "More" section if they cannot fit within the main menu.
- Ensure that the website's responsiveness is maintained, so that menu items and the "More" section adapt seamlessly to changes in screen size.
- When the screen size decreases, facilitate the reorganization of menu items and their migration to the "More" section. Conversely, as the screen size increases, reintegrate items from the "More" section back into the main menu.

## Requirement 2: Carousel

- Build an engaging circular carousel that showcases featured items.
- Allow users to navigate through the carousel using arrow controls and user interactions with the displayed cards.
- Upon user interaction with a card, ensure that the carousel smoothly transitions to the main card and highlights the clicked or selected item.
- The items should rotate continuously in a circular manner, creating an infinite loop of content on navigation.
